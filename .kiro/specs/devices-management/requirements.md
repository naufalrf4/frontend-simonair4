# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The devices management module provides a comprehensive interface for users to manage their IoT aquarium monitoring devices. This feature enables users to pair new devices, view device status and sensor data, edit device configurations, and manage their device inventory through an intuitive user interface. The module integrates with the existing backend API and maintains consistency with the current dashboard design patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an aquarium owner, I want to view all my registered devices in a paginated list, so that I can easily browse and manage my device inventory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the devices page THEN the system SHALL display all devices accessible to the current user
2. WHEN there are more than 10 devices THEN the system SHALL implement pagination with configurable page size
3. WHEN the user enters text in the search field THEN the system SHALL filter devices by device name, device ID, or location
4. WHEN a device is online THEN the system SHALL display current sensor readings and connection status
5. WHEN a device is offline THEN the system SHALL show the last known status and offline indicator
6. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show loading states during data fetching

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an aquarium owner, I want to pair a new device to my account, so that I can monitor additional aquariums.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Add Device" THEN the system SHALL open a device pairing modal
2. WHEN the user enters device details THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (device_id, device_name, location)
3. WHEN the user specifies aquarium size THEN the system SHALL provide separate input fields for length, width, height and format as "LxWxH cm"
4. WHEN the user submits valid device data THEN the system SHALL create the device via POST /devices API
5. WHEN device creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL close the modal and refresh the device list
6. WHEN device creation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
7. WHEN a device ID already exists THEN the system SHALL show a conflict error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an aquarium owner, I want to view detailed information about a specific device, so that I can see comprehensive device and sensor data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a device card THEN the system SHALL open a device details modal
2. WHEN the details modal opens THEN the system SHALL fetch current device data via GET /devices/{id}
3. WHEN device data loads THEN the system SHALL display device information, sensor readings, and connection history
4. WHEN the device is online THEN the system SHALL show real-time sensor data with timestamps
5. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL show last known readings and offline duration
6. WHEN the modal is open THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit or delete the device

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an aquarium owner, I want to edit my device settings, so that I can update device information when my setup changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Edit Device" THEN the system SHALL open an edit modal with current device data pre-filled
2. WHEN the user modifies device fields THEN the system SHALL validate the updated information
3. WHEN the user updates aquarium size THEN the system SHALL maintain the separate input format and proper storage format
4. WHEN the user submits changes THEN the system SHALL update the device via PATCH /devices/{id}
5. WHEN the update succeeds THEN the system SHALL close the modal and refresh the device data
6. WHEN the update fails THEN the system SHALL display validation or server error messages
7. WHEN the user cancels editing THEN the system SHALL discard changes and close the modal

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an aquarium owner, I want to remove devices I no longer use, so that I can keep my device list clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Delete Device" THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN the user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL delete the device via DELETE /devices/{id}
3. WHEN deletion succeeds THEN the system SHALL remove the device from the list and show success feedback
4. WHEN deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and keep the device in the list
5. WHEN the user cancels deletion THEN the system SHALL close the confirmation dialog without changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an aquarium owner, I want the device management interface to be consistent with the existing dashboard design, so that I have a seamless user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying devices THEN the system SHALL use the existing DeviceCard component design patterns
2. WHEN showing device status THEN the system SHALL use consistent status indicators and colors
3. WHEN displaying modals THEN the system SHALL follow the existing UI component library patterns
4. WHEN handling loading states THEN the system SHALL use consistent loading indicators
5. WHEN showing errors THEN the system SHALL use the established error handling and notification patterns
6. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL be responsive and work on mobile devices

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the devices management code to follow separation of concerns principles, so that the codebase is maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL separate API calls into dedicated service files
2. WHEN defining data structures THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript interfaces in dedicated type files
3. WHEN creating UI components THEN the system SHALL separate presentation logic from business logic
4. WHEN handling state management THEN the system SHALL use appropriate React hooks and patterns
5. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL follow the established feature folder structure
6. WHEN implementing error handling THEN the system SHALL use consistent error handling patterns across all components
